### About LH_Mouse
He is a Chinese C++, C and x86/x64 assembly programmer. Notwithstanding him being pedantic and misanthropic, his brilliantness has been proven to be priceless in both his work and contributions to the open source community. He takes semantical correctness as the primary goal, as well as efficiency and extensibility, with little regard to compatibility.
