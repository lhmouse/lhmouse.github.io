Notwithstanding him being pedantic and misanthropic, his brilliantness has turned out to be priceless in both his work and contributions to the open source community. He takes semantical correctness as the primary goal, as well as efficiency and extensibility, with little regard to compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Contact Him\r\nPlease send comments and suggestions via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lhmouse/lhmouse.github.io/issues).\r\n",
